# strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3

---

## Deprecation Warning :warning:

Hello! We have some news to share,

We’ve decided it’ll soon be time to end the support for `strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3`.

After years of iterations, Strapi is going to V4 and we won’t maintain V3 packages when it’ll reach its end-of-support milestone (~end of Q3 2022).

If you’ve been using `strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3` and have migrated to V4 (or if you want to), you can find the equivalent and updated version of this package at this [URL](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/tree/master/packages/providers/upload-aws-s3) and with the following name on NPM: `@strapi/provider-upload-aws-s3`.

If you’ve contributed to the development of this package, thank you again for that! We hope to see you on the V4 soon.

The Akemona team

## Configurations

Your configuration is passed down to the provider. (e.g: `new AWS.S3(config)`). You can see the complete list of options [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#constructor-property)

See the [using a provider](https://strapi.akemona.com/documentation/developer-docs/latest/development/plugins/upload.html#using-a-provider) documentation for information on installing and using a provider. And see the [environment variables](https://strapi.akemona.com/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations.html#environment-variables) for setting and using environment variables in your configs.

**Example**

`./config/plugins.js`

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  // ...
  upload: {
    provider: 'aws-s3',
    providerOptions: {
      accessKeyId: env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
      secretAccessKey: env('AWS_ACCESS_SECRET'),
      region: env('AWS_REGION'),
      params: {
        Bucket: env('AWS_BUCKET'),
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

## Required AWS Policy Actions

These are the minimum amount of permissions needed for this provider to work.

```
"Action": [
  "s3:PutObject",
