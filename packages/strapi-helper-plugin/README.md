# Strapi Helper Plugin

---

## Deprecation Warning :warning:

Hello! We have some news to share,

We’ve decided it’ll soon be time to end the support for `strapi-helper-plugin`.

After years of iterations, Strapi is going to V4 and we won’t maintain V3 packages when it’ll reach its end-of-support milestone (~end of Q3 2022).

If you’ve been using `strapi-helper-plugin` and have migrated to V4 (or if you want to), you can find the equivalent and updated version of this package at this [URL](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/tree/master/packages/core/helper-plugin) and with the following name on NPM: `@strapi/helper-plugin`.

If you’ve contributed to the development of this package, thank you again for that! We hope to see you on the V4 soon.

The Akemona team
